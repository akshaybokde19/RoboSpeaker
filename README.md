**RoboSpeaker 1.0** is a simple text-to-speech application built using Python and the `pyttsx3` library. It allows users to input text, which the program converts into speech, making it a fun and interactive tool for communication. Users can exit the program anytime by typing "q". 

This project demonstrates:
- How to implement text-to-speech functionality.
- A user-friendly interface with looping prompts.
- Python's capability to create practical and engaging applications using libraries like `pyttsx3`.
